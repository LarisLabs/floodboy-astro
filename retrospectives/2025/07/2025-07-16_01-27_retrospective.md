- 08:28 - Completed session with retrospective

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
(none - planning phase only)
```

### Key Code Changes
- No code implemented yet - comprehensive planning completed
- Defined TypeScript config structure for 20 FloodBoy stores
- Planned redirect route implementation
- Designed alias directory page

### Architecture Decisions
- TypeScript config over JSON/Markdown for type safety
- Simple redirects over complex refactoring
- for...of loop for cleaner array building
- Hybrid static/dynamic approach (static URLs, dynamic data)

## AI Diary
Started by analyzing the Floodboy Astro project to understand its architecture. Initially misunderstood the requirement - thought user wanted static data generation at build time, which led to an overcomplicated solution with data pre-fetching. 

The pivotal moment came when user clarified they just wanted static URLs (for SEO) but with dynamic data loading (to avoid stale data). This completely changed the approach from complex to simple.

Went through several iterations:
1. Complex static data fetching (rejected)
2. Hybrid with data pre-fetching (rejected)  
3. Simple redirect approach (accepted)
4. Refined to use for...of loop (final)

Also explored GitHub Projects integration, discovered CLI was outdated, helped upgrade it, and successfully created a public project board for tracking development.

## What Went Well
- Quick adaptation when requirements were clarified
- Clean evolution from complex to simple solution
- Successfully set up GitHub Projects with new CLI
- Created comprehensive implementation plan with ~120 lines of code
- Good use of TypeScript for type safety

## What Could Improve
- Should have asked for clarification earlier about static data vs static URLs
- Could have suggested the simple redirect approach first
- Need to remember to check tool versions before attempting features

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Initial misunderstanding of static generation requirements
  **Resolution**: User clarified they wanted static URLs, not static data

- **Blocker**: GitHub CLI v2.4.0 didn't support project commands
  **Resolution**: User upgraded to v2.75.1

- **Blocker**: Missing project scope in GitHub token
  **Resolution**: Added project scope with gh auth refresh

## Honest Feedback
The session showed the importance of clarifying requirements early. I overcomplicated the initial solution by assuming "static generation" meant pre-fetching all data at build time. The simple redirect approach is much cleaner and maintains the existing codebase integrity. The GitHub Projects integration was a valuable addition for project management visibility.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Always clarify "static" - could mean URLs, data, or both
- **Mistake**: Assumed complex requirements without verification - Always start simple
- **Discovery**: GitHub CLI project commands are powerful for automation - Use them more

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement aliases.config.ts with 20 FloodBoy stores
- [ ] Create /s/[identifier].astro redirect route
- [ ] Create /s/index.astro directory page
- [ ] Test static route generation
- [ ] Move issue #40 to "In Progress" on project board
