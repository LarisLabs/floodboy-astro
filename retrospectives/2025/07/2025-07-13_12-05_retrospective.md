## Session Summary
Successfully integrated real factory data from JIBCHAIN, removing all mock data. Then discovered and fixed a critical UI overflow issue when sensor data exceeded physical limits.

## Timeline
- 18:05 - Started with `nnn` to plan real factory data integration
- 18:10 - Updated factory address to new deployment
- 18:15 - Removed all mock data from stores page
- 18:20 - Consolidated stores listing into /blockchain route
- 18:25 - Successfully displaying 3 real stores from JIBCHAIN
- 18:30 - Merged PR #10, closed related issues
- 18:35 - Discovered water level overflow issue (4.76m > 2.5m sensor range)
- 18:40 - Discussed handling approach for unconstrained blockchain data
- 18:45 - Implemented defensive UI solution
- 18:55 - Fixed text cropping issue
- 19:00 - Created PR #14 for overflow fix

### Files Modified

```

### Key Code Changes
- Updated factory address: `0x99f528a4726f4fc7b24f20ba4631d6bd70ec28d9`
- Removed mock data fallback completely
- Added overflow handling: `Math.min(waterLevel, installationHeight)`
- Implemented warning indicators for invalid data

### Architecture Decisions
- Decision 1: Keep smart contract as simple data store without validation
- Decision 2: Handle all validation at UI level defensively
- Decision 3: Show actual values for transparency with clear warnings

## AI Diary
Started with implementing the plan from `nnn` to integrate real factory data. The integration went smoothly - updated the factory address, removed mock data, and successfully displayed 3 real stores from JIBCHAIN.

Then encountered an interesting edge case: water level data (4.76m) exceeding the sensor's physical range (2.5m). This revealed that the smart contract has no validation constraints - it's just a blockchain database that accepts any values.

Had a good discussion about where validation should happen. Since we can't control what's already in the blockchain, implemented a defensive UI approach that caps visualization but shows actual values with warnings.

## What Went Well
- Clean factory data integration
- Quick identification of overflow issue
- Effective defensive programming solution
- Good use of visual indicators for data integrity

## What Could Improve
- Could have anticipated data validation issues earlier
- Initial text positioning needed adjustment

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Water visualization overflowing canvas bounds
  **Resolution**: Capped rendering at installation height while showing actual value

## Honest Feedback
The session demonstrated good problem-solving when unexpected data appeared. The approach of maintaining transparency (showing actual blockchain data) while preventing UI breakage is the right balance.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Always implement defensive UI for blockchain data - it's unvalidated
- **Mistake**: Initial overflow text was cropped - fixed by centering
- **Discovery**: Smart contracts as pure data stores need UI-level validation

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor for other edge cases in sensor data
- [ ] Consider adding data validation at ingestion point
- [ ] Document expected sensor data ranges
