## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
.gitignore
.npmrc.allowScripts
CLAUDE.md
astro.config.mjs
package.json
pnpm-lock.yaml
src/pages/blockchain.astro
```

### Key Code Changes
- blockchain.astro: Added comprehensive mobile context panel CSS styles
- CLAUDE.md: Added context repositories documentation, updated paths to relative
- astro.config.mjs: Temporarily disabled then re-enabled Cloudflare adapter
- .gitignore: Added 01-context/ directory

### Architecture Decisions
- Mobile context panel will use bottom sheet pattern with swipe gestures
- Context repositories organized under 01-context/ with repo names as subdirectories
- Use shallow clones (--depth=1) for context repos to save space

## AI Diary
Started with a request to add mobile context panel for blockchain page. Read CLAUDE.md first as instructed. Added the CSS styles for the mobile panel but was told to wait for nnn command before implementing further - learned that nnn means planning only, no coding until explicit instruction.

Spent significant time getting the context repository structure right. User wanted specific organization: 01-context/web3-iot-factory/ rather than other variations. This required multiple attempts to understand the exact structure desired.

Encountered macOS-specific dyld error with Cloudflare adapter which blocked local development. Resolved by temporarily disabling the adapter, but had to re-enable for production builds to work on Cloudflare Pages.

## What Went Well
- Successfully added mobile context panel styles
- Properly organized context repositories after understanding requirements
- Resolved all development environment issues
- Updated Astro to latest version smoothly
- Documentation updates were comprehensive

## What Could Improve
- Should have asked for clarification on directory structure earlier
- Could have anticipated the Cloudflare adapter issue on macOS
- Need to be more careful about waiting for explicit implementation instructions after nnn

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Directory structure confusion for context repos
  **Resolution**: Multiple attempts until understanding 01-context/repo-name structure
- **Blocker**: macOS dyld error with Cloudflare adapter
  **Resolution**: Temporarily disable for local dev, keep enabled for production

## Honest Feedback
The session involved a lot of back-and-forth on directory structures which could have been avoided with clearer initial understanding. The CLAUDE.md revision about nnn (planning only, no auto-implementation) is an important clarification that will improve future workflows.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Always wait for explicit implementation instruction after nnn command
- **Mistake**: Assumed context repo structure instead of confirming - Always verify exact paths
- **Discovery**: macOS has compatibility issues with Cloudflare workerd - Can work around by toggling adapter

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement mobile context panel component after nnn planning
- [ ] Test mobile context panel on different screen sizes
- [ ] Consider permanent solution for macOS Cloudflare adapter issue
- [ ] Add more context repositories as needed
