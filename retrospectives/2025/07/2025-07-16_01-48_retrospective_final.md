## Technical Details

### Files Modified

retrospectives/2025/07/2025-07-16_01-27_retrospective.md
retrospectives/2025/07/2025-07-16_01-42_retrospective_continuation.md
```

### Key Code Changes
- CLAUDE.md: Added GitHub Projects workflow section
- CLAUDE.md: Updated project board URL from #6 to #7
- CLAUDE.md: Rewrote retrospective section to remove export references
- Retrospectives: Fixed session times and created continuation

### Architecture Decisions
- TypeScript config with for...of loop for clean alias management
- Simple redirect approach over complex static data generation
- Organization-level projects linked to repository
- Removed export command references for cleaner workflow

## AI Diary
This session was a journey from complexity to simplicity. Started by analyzing the Floodboy Astro project architecture and understanding the requirement for alias URLs. Initially misunderstood and proposed a complex solution with static data generation at build time.

The pivotal moment came when the user clarified they wanted static URLs (for SEO) but dynamic data loading (to avoid stale data). This completely changed the approach to a simple redirect system.

Discovered the GitHub CLI was outdated, helped upgrade it, and learned about the `gh project link` command which wasn't initially known. This made project setup much cleaner than manual web interface approaches.

The session ended with updating documentation to reflect all learnings and remove unnecessary complexity like export commands.

## What Went Well
- Quick adaptation when requirements were clarified
- Clean evolution from complex to simple solution
- Successfully set up GitHub Projects with proper linking
- Created comprehensive implementation plan (~120 lines)
- Updated documentation immediately with new discoveries
- Efficient use of for...of loop for cleaner code

## What Could Improve
- Should have asked for clarification earlier about static data vs URLs
- Could have checked CLI version before attempting project commands
- Time estimation was off (thought it was 88 minutes, actually 107)

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Misunderstood static generation requirements
  **Resolution**: User clarified, pivoted to redirect approach
  
- **Blocker**: GitHub CLI outdated (v2.4.0)
  **Resolution**: User upgraded to v2.75.1
  
- **Blocker**: Projects not linked to repository
  **Resolution**: Discovered gh project link command

## Honest Feedback
The session demonstrated the importance of clarifying requirements early. The simple redirect approach is much cleaner than the initially proposed solution. GitHub Projects integration adds valuable project management visibility. The documentation updates help capture institutional knowledge effectively.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Always clarify "static" - could mean URLs, data, or both
- **Discovery**: `gh project link` command exists for CLI-based project linking
- **Improvement**: Check tool versions before attempting advanced features
- **Simplicity**: Redirect approach is cleaner than complex refactoring

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement aliases.config.ts with 20 FloodBoy stores
- [ ] Create /s/[identifier].astro redirect route
- [ ] Create /s/index.astro directory page
- [ ] Test static route generation
- [ ] Move issue #40 to "In Progress" on project board
