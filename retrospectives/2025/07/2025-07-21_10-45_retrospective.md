## Session Summary
Productive session fixing multiple UI/UX issues in the FloodBoy blockchain dashboard. Fixed social media preview images, improved sensor data display to show "No data" instead of misleading zeros, added proper visualization handling for sensors without data, and implemented dynamic installation height reading from blockchain contracts.

### Key Code Changes
1. **OG Image Fix**: Changed default from Astro placeholder to FloodBoy logo
2. **Site URL**: Updated from example.com to blockchain.floodboy.online
3. **No Data Display**: Show "No data" instead of zeros for missing sensor values
4. **Visualization Handling**: Conditional rendering based on data availability
5. **Dynamic Installation Height**: Read from blockchain instead of hardcoded 2.5m

### Architecture Decisions
- Use "No data" text for missing values rather than zeros
- Show "Sensor Not Installed" when no records exist
- Default to 3.0m installation height when not specified
- Use 2 decimal precision for height display
- Parse scale factors dynamically from unit strings

## AI Diary

Started with a simple bug report about Astro logo appearing in social media previews. This cascaded into several related fixes that significantly improved the user experience.

The OG image issue was straightforward - just needed to change the default image. But discovered the site URL was still "example.com" which would cause broken preview links. Fixed both quickly.

User then pointed out zeros showing for missing sensor data, which is misleading. Implemented proper null handling to show "No data" in gray italic text. This led to the realization that the visualization shouldn't show at all when there's no data.

Added conditional rendering with a nice "ðŸ“¡ Sensor Not Installed" message. Also added timestamps showing when data was last updated, and proper online/offline/dead state calculations based on data age.

Finally tackled the installation height issue from earlier planning. The blockchain already stores this value, but the UI was hardcoding to 2.5m. Implemented dynamic reading with proper scaling factor parsing. User requested 2 decimal precision for consistency.

Each fix built on the previous ones, creating a much more polished and accurate sensor dashboard.

## What Went Well
- Quick identification and fixes for all issues
- Clean GitHub workflow execution
- Reused existing patterns (formatScaledValue already had dynamic scaling)
- Good incremental improvements building on each other
- Clear visual feedback for different sensor states

## What Could Improve
- Could have noticed the site URL issue when fixing OG images
- Initial implementation used wrong decimal precision
- Some PRs could have been combined (OG image + site URL)

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Main branch didn't have some fixes when branching
  **Resolution**: Worked with the current state, no conflicts arose

## Honest Feedback
Very productive session with clear user feedback driving improvements. The cascade of fixes from OG images â†’ site URL â†’ data display â†’ visualization â†’ installation height showed good problem discovery. Each issue revealed related problems that needed fixing. The codebase patterns were consistent enough to make implementations straightforward.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Always check related configurations when fixing URLs/domains
- **Discovery**: Astro's default blog placeholders contain Astro branding - projects must replace these
- **Insight**: Showing "No data" is much clearer than showing zeros
- **Practice**: Conditional rendering prevents misleading visualizations

## Next Steps
- [x] Merge all PRs
- [x] Close completed issues
- [ ] Monitor for any issues with dynamic installation height
- [ ] Consider adding more sensor metadata fields
