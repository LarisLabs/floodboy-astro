## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
src/config/aliases.config.ts
src/pages/s/[identifier].astro
src/pages/s/index.astro
```

### Key Code Changes
- aliases.config.ts: TypeScript configuration with 20 FloodBoy stores using for...of loop
- [identifier].astro: Dynamic route with SSR fallback for redirects
- index.astro: Directory listing page with grid layout

### Architecture Decisions
- Used for...of loop pattern as requested for cleaner code
- SSR fallback (prerender = false) for dynamic address access
- Simple redirect approach instead of complex data fetching
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

## AI Diary
This was a smooth implementation session. Started by checking for context and realized issue #40 already contained the complete implementation code. The only hiccup was the Layout import - initially tried to import from Layout.astro which didn't exist, but quickly found that BaseLayout.astro was the correct component. 

The Puppeteer testing worked well with headless mode, confirming both alias redirects and direct address access functioned correctly. The implementation was straightforward since all the code was already planned in the issue.

## What Went Well
- Complete implementation plan in issue #40 made coding quick
- All features worked on first try (after Layout fix)
- Build succeeded without TypeScript errors
- Puppeteer testing confirmed functionality
- Clean PR created with comprehensive description

## What Could Improve
- Should have checked existing Layout components first
- Could have skipped creating duplicate issue #42

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Layout.astro didn't exist
  **Resolution**: Found and used BaseLayout.astro instead

## Honest Feedback
Having the complete implementation code in the issue made this extremely efficient. The for...of loop pattern requested by the user is indeed cleaner than alternatives. The redirect approach is simple and effective.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Always check existing component names before importing
- **Discovery**: Astro's SSR fallback with prerender = false works seamlessly
- **Efficiency**: Well-planned issues with code examples speed up implementation

## Next Steps
- [x] Merge PR #43
- [ ] Optionally add navigation link to /s/ directory
- [ ] Monitor for any issues with redirects in production
