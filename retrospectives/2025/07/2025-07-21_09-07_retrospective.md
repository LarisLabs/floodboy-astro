## Session Summary
Fixed the social media preview image issue where Astro branding was showing instead of FloodBoy branding. Implemented a quick fix by changing the default OG image from the Astro-branded placeholder to the FloodBoy logo.

## Timeline
- 08:45 - Started session, user reported preview share shows Astro logo
- 08:46 - Performed nnn workflow (ccc first, then created plan)
- 08:50 - Created context issue #47 and plan issue #48
- 08:55 - Started implementation with GitHub workflow
- 08:58 - Updated BaseHead.astro to use FloodBoy logo
- 09:00 - Tested changes locally, verified OG meta tags
- 09:02 - Created PR #49
- 09:03 - Completed implementation

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
src/components/BaseHead.astro
```

### Key Code Changes
- BaseHead.astro: Changed default OG image from `/blog-placeholder-1.jpg` to `/floodboy-logo.png`

### Architecture Decisions
- Quick fix approach: Use existing FloodBoy logo instead of creating custom OG images
- Rationale: Immediate solution to remove Astro branding, can create optimized OG images later

## AI Diary
Started with user reporting that preview shares show Astro logo. Used the nnn workflow which automatically triggered ccc first since no recent context existed. Found that blog-placeholder-1.jpg contained Astro branding (logo, "Build the web you want" text, mascot). 

Discovered the project already had a FloodBoy logo at /public/floodboy-logo.png being used in header and footer. Decided on quick fix approach - simply change the default image rather than creating new OG-optimized images. This immediately solves the branding issue.

Implementation was straightforward - single line change in BaseHead.astro. Tested locally by checking the rendered HTML meta tags since MCP Puppeteer had display issues.

## What Went Well
- nnn workflow correctly identified need for ccc first
- Found existing FloodBoy logo asset quickly
- Simple one-line fix solved the immediate problem
- Clean GitHub workflow execution
- Quick turnaround time (18 minutes total)

## What Could Improve
- Could create proper 1200x630px OG images for optimal social media display
- FloodBoy logo might not be ideal dimensions for preview cards
- Site URL still set to "example.com" in config

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: MCP Puppeteer couldn't launch (missing X server)
  **Resolution**: Used curl to check rendered HTML meta tags instead

## Honest Feedback
The nnn workflow worked perfectly - it automatically detected no recent context and ran ccc first. This saved time and ensured proper documentation. The fix itself was trivial but effective. While using the logo directly isn't optimal for social media previews (wrong aspect ratio), it's much better than showing competitor branding.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Always check for existing assets before creating new ones
- **Discovery**: Astro's default blog placeholders contain Astro branding - projects should replace these
- **Improvement**: OG images should ideally be 1200x630px for best display across platforms

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create proper 1200x630px OG images for FloodBoy
- [ ] Update site URL from "example.com" to production domain
- [ ] Consider page-specific OG images for better engagement
