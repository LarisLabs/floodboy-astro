## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
CLAUDE.md
retrospectives/2025/07/2025-07-16_01-27_retrospective.md
```

### Key Code Changes
- CLAUDE.md: Added gh project link command to instructions
- CLAUDE.md: Updated project board URL from #6 to #7
- Retrospective: Fixed incorrect session times

### Architecture Decisions
- Use single project board (#7) instead of multiple
- Link projects via CLI command rather than manual web interface

## AI Diary
This was a quick follow-up session to fix the GitHub Projects setup. Learned about the `gh project link` command which wasn't initially known. This makes the setup much cleaner than the manual web interface approach.

## What Went Well
- Quick discovery of gh project link command
- Clean project setup with proper repository linking
- Updated documentation immediately

## What Could Improve
- Should have searched for link command initially
- Could have checked gh project help documentation first

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Projects created but not visible in repository
  **Resolution**: Used gh project link command to connect them

## Honest Feedback
The GitHub CLI has more features than initially apparent. The help documentation and examples are valuable resources that should be consulted more frequently.

## Lessons Learned
- **Discovery**: `gh project link` command exists for linking projects to repos
- **Pattern**: Always check CLI help for additional commands
- **Improvement**: Document new discoveries immediately in CLAUDE.md

## Next Steps
- [ ] Begin implementation of issue #40
- [ ] Move issue to "In Progress" on project board
- [ ] Start with aliases.config.ts implementation
