### Files Completely Rebuilt
```
public/floodboy-react-demo.html - 86% rewritten, 816 insertions(+), 782 deletions(-)
```

### Key Architectural Changes
- **Data Source**: Event logs → Direct contract calls (blockchain-simple.html pattern)
- **RPC Endpoint**: rpc2-l1.jbc.xpool.pw → rpc-l1.jbc.xpool.pw (working endpoint)
- **Scaling Logic**: Hardcoded factors → Dynamic formatValue() function
- **Chart Type**: Bar chart → Line chart → Historical timeline
- **Data Range**: Current only → 24 hours → 7 days (100+ points)
- **Chart Focus**: All metrics → Water-level-focused with toggleable battery

### Critical Bug Resolution
**Problem**: Installation height showing 1.05m instead of 3.02m
**Root Cause**: React demo using stale event logs (raw 1290) vs current contract data (raw 30200)
**Solution**: Complete rebuild using proven blockchain-simple.html data patterns

### Final Implementation Features
- **Water Level History**: Primary blue line, always visible
- **Battery Voltage**: Secondary green line, hidden by default, toggleable
- **Historical Range**: 7 days with 100 data points
- **Time Labels**: "Jul 25, 02:15 PM" format for extended range
- **Chart Title**: "Water Level History (100 Points - 7 Days)"
- **Data Accuracy**: Installation=3.02m, Water=0.53m, Battery=12.91V ✅

## AI Diary
This was one of the most challenging and rewarding sessions I've experienced. What started as a seemingly simple chart scaling issue revealed fundamental architectural problems in the React demo's data pipeline.

The first 2 hours were frustrating - I kept trying to fix the scaling factors and RPC endpoints, but the core issue was that the React demo was fundamentally using a different data retrieval pattern than the working baselines. The user's suggestion to "destroy and rebuild from blockchain-simple.html" was the breakthrough moment.

The rebuild process was methodical and satisfying. Starting with the exact same configuration, ABIs, and data patterns as the working baseline, then progressively adding React demo features while maintaining the proven data accuracy. Each enhancement was tested and verified:

1. **Basic rebuild**: Accurate data ✅
2. **Line chart**: Better visualization ✅  
3. **Historical data**: 24-hour timeline ✅
4. **Extended data**: 7-day range with 100+ points ✅
5. **Water-focused**: Primary flood monitoring metric ✅

The MCP Puppeteer analysis was crucial throughout - being able to visually verify each change and see the actual chart rendering made the debugging process much more effective than traditional console-based debugging.

The final water-focused implementation is particularly elegant. By making water level the primary visible line and battery voltage toggleable, we created a interface that's optimized for flood monitoring use cases while still providing access to secondary metrics when needed.

## What Went Well
- **Complete Rebuild Strategy**: Starting fresh from working foundation was the right approach
- **Methodical Enhancement**: Each step validated before proceeding to next
- **MCP Puppeteer Validation**: Visual verification caught issues that console logs missed
- **User Guidance**: Critical suggestion to rebuild rather than patch fixes
- **Data Accuracy Achievement**: Final values exactly match baseline references
- **Professional UI**: Production-ready flood monitoring dashboard

## What Could Improve
- **Initial Diagnosis Time**: Spent too long on incremental fixes vs architectural solution
- **Data Source Analysis**: Should have compared data sources earlier
- **Testing Methodology**: Could have used MCP analysis from the start
- **Documentation**: Real-time documentation would have helped track changes

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Scaling factor fixes not resolving core data discrepancy
  **Resolution**: Complete rebuild from working blockchain-simple.html foundation

- **Blocker**: Chart rendering issues with enhanced legend functionality  
  **Resolution**: Simplified legend implementation while maintaining toggle functionality

- **Blocker**: Event log data vs contract call data inconsistency
  **Resolution**: Used proven direct contract call pattern from baseline

## Honest Feedback
This was a masterclass in software debugging and problem-solving. The initial approach of trying to patch the existing broken implementation was classic "good money after bad" - sometimes you need to admit the foundation is wrong and rebuild properly.

The user's insight to destroy and rebuild was spot-on. It reminded me that sometimes the fastest path to a working solution is not trying to fix what's broken, but rather building on what already works.

The final result exceeded the original requirements - we didn't just fix the broken chart, we created a superior flood monitoring interface with historical data visualization, proper chart types, and water-level-focused design.

The MCP Puppeteer tooling proved invaluable for this type of UI debugging work.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Rebuild from Working Foundation - When fixes aren't working, rebuild from proven code
- **Pattern**: User Insight Validation - Sometimes users see architectural issues that detailed debugging misses
- **Pattern**: Visual Debugging with MCP - Browser automation excellent for UI/chart validation
- **Pattern**: Progressive Enhancement - Build basic working version first, then add features incrementally
- **Mistake**: Over-Engineering Fixes - Spent too long trying to patch broken architecture
- **Discovery**: Water-Focused Design - Flood monitoring charts work better with primary metric emphasis

## Next Steps
- [x] Commit water-focused chart enhancement
- [ ] Update open code page with new React demo
- [ ] Write technical blog post about the debugging methodology
- [ ] Consider applying water-focused design to other blockchain viewers
