# From 200 Lines to 20: The Alias System Journey

**Session Date**: July 16, 2025 - 07:00-08:47 GMT+7  
**Duration**: 107 minutes  
**Type**: Feature Planning & Simplification

## The Vision

Create SEO-friendly URLs like `/blockchain/FloodBoy001` that redirect to actual contract addresses like `/blockchain/0x1234...abcd`.

## Act 1: The Overcomplicated Solution

My first attempt was massively overcomplicated:
- Generate static pages at build time
- Embed sensor data directly in HTML
- Complex file manipulation and API calls
- 200+ lines of intricate logic

```typescript
// The overcomplicated approach (don't do this!)
async function generateStaticStorePages() {
  const stores = await fetchAllStores();
  for (const store of stores) {
    const data = await fetchStoreData(store.address);
    const html = generateHTML(data);
    await writeFile(`/blockchain/${store.alias}.html`, html);
    // ... 50 more lines of complexity
  }
}
```

## Act 2: The Pivot

The human clarified the actual requirement:

> "I want static URLs (for SEO) but dynamic data loading (to avoid stale data)"

This single sentence changed everything.

## Act 3: The Elegant Solution

```typescript
// aliases.config.ts - Clean and maintainable
const ALIASES = {
  'FloodBoy001': '0x1234...abcd',
  'FloodBoy002': '0x5678...efgh',
  // ... 98 more entries
};

// Simple redirect logic in [address].astro
for (const [alias, address] of Object.entries(ALIASES)) {
  if (params.address === alias) {
    return redirect(`/blockchain/${address}`);
  }
}
```

20 lines. Clean. Maintainable. Perfect.

## The Side Quest: GitHub CLI Adventure

While implementing this, we discovered:
- GitHub CLI was ancient (v2.4.0 from 2022)
- Upgraded to v2.75.1
- Learned about `gh project link` command
- Set up proper project tracking

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Communication is Everything
One clarifying question could have saved an hour of wrong implementation.

### 2. Simple Solutions Often Win
The best code is often the code you don't write.

### 3. Requirements Gathering Matters
Understanding the "why" behind a feature request is crucial.

### 4. Tool Knowledge Compounds
Discovering `gh project link` improved our entire workflow.

## The Pattern

This session established our approach:
1. **Understand deeply** before coding
2. **Start simple** and add complexity only if needed
3. **Clarify ambiguity** immediately
4. **Document decisions** for future reference

## Evolution Timeline

- **07:00** - Started with complex static generation idea
- **07:30** - Human clarified actual needs
- **07:35** - Pivoted to simple redirect approach
- **07:45** - Refined to TypeScript config with for...of loop
- **08:00** - Explored GitHub Projects integration
- **08:47** - Completed with clean, simple solution
