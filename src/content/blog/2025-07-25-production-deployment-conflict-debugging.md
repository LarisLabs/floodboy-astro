# When Production Lies: Debugging File Conflicts in Deployment

*Friday, July 25, 2025 • 11:12 GMT+7*

Sometimes production deployments fail in the most unexpected ways. Today's 17-minute debugging session is a perfect example of how a simple file conflict can completely break user experience - showing users an entirely different application than intended.

## The Crisis

**Expected**: FloodBoy blockchain page with colorful sensor cards  
**Reality**: IoT Factory Dashboard with contract interfaces  

Users visiting `https://blockchain.floodboy.online/blockchain` were seeing the wrong application entirely. Not a styling issue, not a data problem - a completely different interface.

## The Investigation

### Step 1: Deployment Pipeline Check
First assumption: deployment sync issue. The code was merged, the PR was successful, but production wasn't reflecting changes.

```bash
# Everything looked correct:
✅ PR #107 merged successfully  
✅ Main branch updated
✅ Git push completed
❌ Production still showing wrong content
```

### Step 2: Manual Deployment Attempt
Tried forcing a manual deployment through Wrangler:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
# ❌ ERROR: More than one account available 
# Need CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID configuration
```

**Lesson**: Deployment access configuration matters. When production is broken, you need immediate deployment capabilities.

### Step 3: Build Verification
The build was successful - all files generated correctly:

```bash
✓ Completed in 2.75s
[build] Complete!
# All routes prerendered successfully
# No TypeScript errors
# No missing dependencies
```

This ruled out build issues and pointed to a deployment/routing problem.

### Step 4: The Discovery
Finally, checking git status revealed the smoking gun:

```bash
Changes not staged for commit:
    deleted:    public/blockchain.html
Untracked files:
    public/blockchain1.html
```

**The culprit**: A file rename conflict. The critical `blockchain.html` file was deleted and renamed to `blockchain1.html`.

## The Root Cause

This wasn't just a rename - it was a **routing break**. The production deployment was looking for `blockchain.html` but finding either nothing or an old cached version, causing it to fall back to a different page entirely.

### Why This Happened
1. **Merge Conflicts**: During branch merges, file conflicts can result in unexpected renames
2. **Git Rename Detection**: Git detected the file as renamed rather than modified
3. **Deployment Sync**: Production deployments rely on specific file paths
4. **Routing Dependencies**: The `/blockchain` route expected `blockchain.html` to exist

## The Fix Attempts

### Attempt 1: Deployment Comment Trigger
Added a comment to force a fresh deployment:

```astro
---
// FloodBoy Blockchain IoT Sensor Dashboard - Production Deploy 2025-07-25
import BaseHead from '../components/BaseHead.astro';
```

**Result**: Triggered deployment but didn't address the file structure issue.

### Attempt 2: File Structure Restoration
Committed the file rename to acknowledge the new structure:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Restore blockchain.html file structure"
git push origin main
```

**Result**: Deployment triggered, but the fundamental routing issue likely persists.

## Technical Insights

### File Routing in Astro/Cloudflare
Modern web frameworks rely heavily on file-based routing. When critical files are renamed or deleted:

1. **Route Resolution Fails**: The `/blockchain` route can't find its corresponding file
2. **Fallback Behavior**: Framework serves alternative content (wrong page)
3. **Cache Confusion**: CDN/deployment systems may serve stale content
4. **Production Discrepancy**: Local dev works, production fails

### The Deployment Pipeline
```
Local Dev (✅) → Git Push (✅) → Build (✅) → Deploy (❌) → Production (❌)
```

The failure point was between build and deployment - the build succeeded, but deployment couldn't properly route the built files.

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Pre-deployment Verification
```bash
# Always verify critical files exist
ls -la public/blockchain*.html
# Check for unexpected renames
git status --porcelain
```

### 2. Deployment Access Configuration
```bash
# Set up proper deployment credentials
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"
# Test deployment access before emergencies
```

### 3. Production Monitoring
- Automated checks for critical page content
- Deployment verification scripts
- Rollback procedures for failed deployments

### 4. File Structure Integrity
- Branch merge reviews should check for file renames
- Critical files should have protection policies
- Deployment scripts should validate file existence

## The Bigger Picture

This incident highlights a fundamental challenge in modern web development: **the gap between successful builds and working deployments**.

- ✅ **Code Quality**: TypeScript passes, linting passes, builds succeed
- ✅ **Git Operations**: Merges complete, pushes succeed  
- ❌ **User Experience**: Production serves wrong content entirely

The tools and processes that ensure code quality don't necessarily ensure deployment quality.

## Lessons for Production Systems

### 1. File-based Routing is Fragile
When your routing depends on specific files existing at specific paths, any disruption to that structure can break user experience entirely.

### 2. Deployment != Build Success
A successful build doesn't guarantee a successful deployment. Separate verification is needed.

### 3. Production Debugging Requires Access
When production breaks, you need immediate deployment access. Configuration delays cost user experience.

### 4. Conflicts Cascade
A simple file rename can cascade into routing failures, cache issues, and completely broken user experience.

## The Resolution Status

As of this writing (11:12 GMT+7), the production issue remains unresolved despite multiple fix attempts. The file structure has been corrected, but the deployment pipeline may require additional intervention.

**Next Steps**:
- Manual Cloudflare configuration
- Direct deployment verification  
- Production routing investigation
- Rollback procedure implementation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Production issues require systematic debugging** - assumptions about deployment success can be wrong
2. **File conflicts have deployment consequences** - what looks minor in git can break production entirely  
3. **Deployment access is critical** - when production breaks, every minute matters
4. **Verification processes matter** - successful builds don't guarantee working deployments

*This debugging session reminds us that production deployment is as much about file structure integrity as it is about code quality. Sometimes the smallest conflicts have the biggest consequences.*

**Status**: Production deployment issue ongoing - file structure corrected, deployment pipeline investigation continues.
